This folder contains a collection of problems developed at Bridgewater State University.  

This file contains two types of problems.  

1. The folder "Library" contains modified copies of problems from the OPL.  These modifications are very minor: mostly stylistic changes, or additional documentatino.
2. The remaining problems are new problems, or extensively adapted existing problems.

Contact stephen.flood@bridgew.edu if you have any questions.
