<li>
<p>To see what happens as you <em class="emphasis">approach <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> from the left</em>,</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Move the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> value to some number less than <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> For simplicity, start by moving to <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> At that point on the curve, your height will be <span class="process-math">\(y=0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>Drag the slider to increase <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> towards 1, making sure never to allow <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to equal 1.</p>
<p>As you increased <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> (as you move it right), you will have seen the height increase as well.  Even more, you will have seen the height getting closer and closer to <span class="process-math">\(y=2\text{.}\)</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>Because of this, we say that your height <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> gets closer and closer to <span class="process-math">\(y=2\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches 1 from the left.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em class="alert">Important:</em> The fact that <span class="process-math">\(f(1)=3\)</span> is unrelated to our question, because that tells us what happens <em class="emphasis">at that point</em>, not what happens <em class="emphasis">during the process of approaching that point</em>.</p>

<li><p>Drag the slider to <em class="emphasis">decrease</em> <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> toward 1, making sure never to allow <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to equal 1.
