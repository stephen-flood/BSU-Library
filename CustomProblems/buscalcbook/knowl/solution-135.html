<p>We will approximate the slope at a value of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> by first drawing the tangent to the curve at that point.  We can then find two points <em class="alert">on the line</em> and use the slope formula</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Note that these points will not be on the original curve, since we are technically finding the slope of the <em class="emphasis">tangent line</em>, which we are only using to <em class="alert">approximate</em> the real curve.</p>
<p>To find the tangent to a curve at a point, take a ruler and "line it up" with the curve at that point. The interactive graphic below shows the line you would get at each point.</p>
