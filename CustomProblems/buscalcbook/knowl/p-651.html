<p>From a different perspective, it is clear that new cars have many features that older cars do not.  To oversimplify things, suppose  that a new car always has 10% more features than an older car.  If you are going to buy a car that is one year older, you will want the price to decrease enough to make up for that loss in additional features.</p>
