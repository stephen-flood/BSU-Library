<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Understanding Acceleration.</span></h4>
<p>A physical perspective provides one of the most straightforward ways to think about the connection between position, velocity, and acceleration. To make things concrete, suppose that you are driving on a highway, and that</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>If <span class="process-math">\(s(t) = \)</span> your mile marker at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>then <span class="process-math">\(s'(t) = \)</span> is your velocity at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>and <span class="process-math">\(s''(t) = \)</span> your acceleration at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> This tells us <em class="emphasis">how fast</em> the velocity <span class="process-math">\(s'\)</span> is changing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">In other words,</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Positive</em> acceleration <span class="process-math">\(s''\)</span> means that velocity is <em class="emphasis">increasing</em>.  This happens when you put your foot on the gas, as long as the car is in drive.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Negative</em> acceleration <span class="process-math">\(s''\)</span> means that your velocity is <em class="emphasis">decreasing</em>.  This happens when you put your foot on the break, as long as you are moving forward.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="ch-secondderivatives.html#paragraphs-14" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
