</h4>
<p>In any economic transaction, the person selling a product and the person  buying a product have very different perspectives.</p>
<p>We already talked about the <em class="emphasis">buyer's</em> perspective when we talked about the <em class="emphasis">demand</em> price.  We now want to think about the <em class="emphasis">seller's</em> perspective by studying the <em class="emphasis">supply</em> price.</p>
<p>Any seller has a huge number of options available to them.   On any given day, and in any given market, they might decide to create a new product, to cancel an existing product, to go out of business completely, etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, making one product takes up time and energy that could otherwise be used to create another product.  In other words, there are many tradeoffs.</p>
<p>The <dfn class="terminology">supply price</dfn> of a particular number of items refers to the item price that the seller must be able to earn in order to make it worth their time to create that number of items.</p>
<p>For example, you might only be willing to increase production to <span class="process-math">\(x=100\)</span> items if you are sure that you would be able to sell each item for <span class="process-math">\(p=15\)</span>$ each.  In this case, the supply price for 100 items is 15$.</p>
<p>Note that a higher item price will encourage sellers to produce more.  That means that supply functions are always increasing.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch-algebra_linearfunctions.html#insight-2" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
