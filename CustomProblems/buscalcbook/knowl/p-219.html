<p>There are many ways of trying to decide the price at which you will sell an item. In an auction, buyers each decide the maximum price at which they will buy the item, and the individual who has largest maximum price wins the auction. In a going-out-of-business sale, the company starts with high prices, and progressively lowers the price until everything in the store is sold. Each individual has a different maximum price at which they will purchase the item.  The lower the price goes, the more items are sold.</p>
