<p>From the graphs above, it looks like the derivative <span class="process-math">\(C'\)</span> is very close to the average rate of change <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{\Delta C}{\Delta x}\text{,}\)</span> and is a scaled version of the graph of the change <span class="process-math">\(\Delta C\text{.}\)</span> For that reason, the derivative <span class="process-math">\(C'\)</span> is often abbreviated <span class="process-math">\(C' = \dfrac{dC}{dx}\text{.}\)</span> To see why, note that <span class="process-math">\(\Delta\)</span> is Greek for letter “D,” so the notation <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dC}{dx}\)</span> is intended to help you remember that it's very closely related to <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x}\text{.}\)</span></p>
