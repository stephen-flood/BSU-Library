<p>You then compare the different values of Revenue <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> and select the scenario (possible universe) that works best for you. In this case, the meaning of the change in revenue <span class="process-math">\(\Delta R\)</span> between different values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a bit complex. Here, <span class="process-math">\(\Delta R\)</span> represents how much revenue would have changed if you had chosen a different possible universe <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> by deciding to sell additional units by lowering the fixed unit cost that everyone pays.</p>
