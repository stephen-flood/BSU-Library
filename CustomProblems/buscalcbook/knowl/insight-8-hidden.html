<body class="ignore-math"><article class="insight remark-like"><p>In the previous example, we found that the break even quantities were  <span class="process-math">\(x=0.5857\dots\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x=3.4142\dots\text{.}\)</span>  But you cannot sell <span class="process-math">\(0.587\)</span> units, so what does this answer mean practically?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this depends a lot on the specific context of your specific application.</p>
<p>In the simple case of $ profit as a result of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> items given above, you will only be able to make a profit by selling <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> items, <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span> items, or <span class="process-math">\(x=3\)</span> items, since any integer larger or smaller than these will result in a negative profit.</p>
<p>But the power of mathematics is that the same tools can be used to answer questions in very different contexts.  For example, suppose instead that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> was the number of <em class="emphasis">thousands</em> of items sold.  In other words, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(P(5)\)</span> is the profit from selling <em class="emphasis">five thousand</em> items.  In that case, you will break even when you sell <span class="process-math">\(x=0.5857\dots\)</span> <em class="emphasis">thousand</em> items or <span class="process-math">\(x=3.4142\dots\)</span> <em class="emphasis">thousand</em> items.  In that case, you would need to sell between <span class="process-math">\(586\)</span> items and <span class="process-math">\(340\)</span> items to make a proift.</p>
<p>Other applications require even greater precision.  For example, currency exchange rates are often given to at least four decimal places.  But what if you are investing millions of dollars in a foreign currency?  Then the fifth, sixth, etc decimal places will suddenly be more important.</p>
<p>In a <em class="emphasis">mathematics</em> class, we will generally try to keep as much precision as possible.  In any specific <em class="emphasis">application</em>, you should think carefully and consult generally accepted practices related to rounding.</p></article></body>
