<p>In this class, we only need an informal understanding of limits, and the definitions above should be more than enough.</p>
<p>But there is still a little bit of ambiguity in expressions like "getting closer and closer to."  It is natural to ask, how close is close enough? The answer to that question gives us the full, mathematical definition of a limit.</p>
<p>That definition says that <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(x) = L\)</span> if and only if for <em class="emphasis">any</em> acceptable error <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon&gt;0\text{,}\)</span> there is an acceptable distance <span class="process-math">\(d&gt;0\)</span> such that the difference between the actual height <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and the limit height of <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is less than <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> whenever the input <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is no more than distance <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> from the point <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> that you are approaching.</p>
<p>Again, unless you find it helpful we don't need that more formal definition for this class.  The main point is that it is possible to eliminate any ambiguity about what "close enough" really means.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch_limits.html#note-2" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
