<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>You begin with $1000 in a safe, and add $365 each year, spread out evenly over the year. Furthermore, you commit to keeping this up for ten years. You want to study the value in the safe as a function of time.</p>
<p>To allow the amount of time to vary, we introduce an independent variable. Often, we use <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for the independent variable, which in this case is time. We also often use <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> for the dependent variable, which in this case is the amount saved. Putting this together, we get</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
y = f(x) = 1000 + 365 x \text{ for }x\text{ in } [0,10]
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Reading from left to right, this says that the output balance <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in $ is equal to a function of the input time <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and that we will use the letter <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to refer this function.</p>
<p>It also says that this function is defined by a <em class="emphasis">rule</em>, which says to take the number of years <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> to multiply that by 365, and then to add $1000.</p>
<p>Finally, that sentence says that this rule applies only when the input <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is in the closed interval <span class="process-math">\([0,10]\text{,}\)</span> which means that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> can be any number in the interval <span class="process-math">\(0\leq x\leq 10\)</span></p>
<p>Notice that this interval contains decimals like <span class="process-math">\(4.5\)</span> years, as well as whole numbers like <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> years. This allows us to find the amount in the safe after <span class="process-math">\(40\)</span> days.  Assuming that there are 365 days in a year, day <span class="process-math">\(40\)</span> happens after <span class="process-math">\(x=\frac{40}{365}=0.1096\)</span> years.</p></article></body>
