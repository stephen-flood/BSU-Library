<dt>Removable Discontinuity</dt>
<dd>
<p><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img_continuity_1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> Imagine running along this graph. The discontinuity is a hole in the ground, like an open manhole cover. If you were to walk over that hole, you would fall down the hole, and hit the ground at the bottom. But it seems like someone should be able to <dfn class="terminology">remove</dfn> this discontinuity by covering up the manhole cover (by redefining the function at that specific point).</p>
<p>We say that <em class="emphasis">any</em> function has a <dfn class="terminology">removable discontinuity</dfn> if the left and right limits both exist, and both equal the same number, but if that number is not equal to <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\text{.}\)</span></p>

<p><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img_continuity_2.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> In this graph, the limit does not exist.  If you imagine running along this curve, you would need to <dfn class="terminology">jump</dfn> to get from one side of the discontinuity to the other.</p>
<p>We say that <em class="emphasis">any</em> function has a <dfn class="terminology">jump discontinuity</dfn> if the left and right limits equal two different finite numbers.</p>

<dt>Infinite Discontinuity</dt>
<dd>
<p><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img_continuity_3.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> In this graph, the left and right limits both go off to infinity, and the graph of the function has a vertical asymptote. If you imagine running along this curve, you would need to be able to go to infinity in the process of getting from one side to the other.</p>
<p>We say that <em class="emphasis">any</em> function has an <dfn class="terminology">infinite discontinuity</dfn> if either the left or right limit goes to infinity.</p>
