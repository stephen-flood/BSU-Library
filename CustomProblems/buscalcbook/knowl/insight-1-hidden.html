<body class="ignore-math"><article class="insight remark-like"><p>In life, and particularly in business, you need to make specific, concrete decisions. You either hire a new employee or you don't. You take out a loan of one amount, rather than another.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you ask yourself <em class="emphasis">what would happen if I make this decision?</em> Or, once it's too late, you might ask yourself <em class="emphasis">what would have happened if I made that decision?</em></p>
<p>When comparing mutually exclusive choices, people often use words like <dfn class="terminology">scenario</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">possible universe</dfn> to identify the different possible options.</p>
<p>There are many ways of trying to decide the price at which you will sell an item. In an auction, buyers each decide the maximum price at which they will buy the item, and the individual who has largest maximum price wins the auction. In a going-out-of-business sale, the company starts with high prices, and progressively lowers the price until everything in the store is sold. Each individual has a different maximum price at which they will purchase the item.  The lower the price goes, the more items are sold.</p>
<p><em class="alert">In this class</em> we always assume a company picks a <em class="emphasis">single item price</em>, and everyone pays that single price.</p>
<p>We also assume that you can change the price from day to day, holding all other things equal.  That means that fewer items will be sold on a day when the price is high, and more items will be sold on a day when the price is low.</p></article></body>
