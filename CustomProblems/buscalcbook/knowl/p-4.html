<p>The material on graphs of totals and changes is based on previous work in collaboration with my colleague Karen Duseau, also of Bridgewater State University. The idea and name of AROC and IROC tables also come from Karen Duseau. To the best of my knowledge, the other examples and exposition in this book are newly written, and are based on ideas in common use. However, it is always possible that something from a textbook or other resource I have used in the past has been unintentionally incorporated in some form or another. If this has happened, please let me know at <a href="mailto:sflood@bridgew.edu">sflood@bridgew.edu</a>, and I will happily correct the oversight.</p>
