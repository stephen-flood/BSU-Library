</h4>
<p>It is actually very hard to measure position directly.  Although GPS is widely used, the system itself is incredibly complex.  From <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-7-hidden.html" title="Footnote 14.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>GPS ... is a satellite-based radionavigation system owned by the United States government and operated by the United States Space Force. It ... provides geolocation ... anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Special and general relativity predicted that the clocks on GPS satellites, as observed by those on Earth, run 38 microseconds faster per day than those on the Earth. The design of GPS corrects for this difference; because without doing so, GPS calculated positions would accumulate errors of up to 10 kilometers per day (6 mi/d).</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, it is much simpler to measure acceleration directly, and most modern electronics such as cell phones have built in self-contained accelerometers. By working backwards from acceleration <span class="process-math">\(s''\)</span> to velocity <span class="process-math">\(s'\)</span> and then to position <span class="process-math">\(s\text{,}\)</span> it is possible to use a sensor that measures <span class="process-math">\(s''\)</span> to model your position <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>For example, <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer#Consumer_electronics" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-8-hidden.html" title="Footnote 14.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> observes that “Some pedometers use an accelerometer to more accurately measure the number of steps taken and distance traveled than a mechanical sensor can provide.”</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch_antiderivatives.html#insight-20" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
