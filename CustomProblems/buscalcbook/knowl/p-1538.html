<p>Something interesting happens when concavity changes. Suppose the bell curve below represents the number of people ill with a new illness. In the bell curve below, the curve starts out concave up (CU), becomes concave down (CD), and ends concave up (CU). <div class="image-box" style="width: 30%; margin-left: 35%; margin-right: 35%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/image_bellcurve2.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> The curve is <em class="emphasis">bent</em> at the two transitions.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>At the first "bending point," the number of new cases continues to rise. However, the daily change in cases (i.e. the slope <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span>) stops getting bigger and starts getting smaller.</p>
<p>In other words, because the second derivative  goes from <span class="process-math">\(f''=(+)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(f''=(-)\text{,}\)</span> the fastest daily change in cases occurs at the first bend in the curve.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At the second "bending point," the number of new cases continues to decrease. However, the daily change in cases (i.e. the slope <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span>) starts to decrease less rapidly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">This is an important mathematical feature, but "bending point" does not a mathematical term.  The word <dfn class="terminology">inflect</dfn> means to bend, to change pitch, or to alter noticeably.</p>
