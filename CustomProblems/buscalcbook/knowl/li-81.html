<p>On the other hand, cars are known to break more and more frequently as they get older.  If you knew which repairs would be required each year, you could make a table of values telling you the value of the vechicle at each point in time (or at each number of miles).  For each year, you would take its value from the previous year, decrease the value based on the reduced mileage of the car, and subtract the expected maintenence from that point of time.</p>
<p>This way of tracking the decrease, or depreciation, is in some ways more accurate than straightline depreciation but is much more complicated to compute.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch_exponentials.html#li-81" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
