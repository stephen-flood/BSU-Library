<p>The domain of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is the set of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-values where the function is defined.  In this example, the function is defined starting at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and stopping at <span class="process-math">\(x=5\text{.}\)</span> Therefore the domain is <span class="process-math">\([0,5]\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>The range of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is the set of <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-values that are output by the function.  Looking at the function, note that you can achieve outputs as small as <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=0\)</span> (at <span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span>) and as large as <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=4\)</span> (at <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span>), as well as every output between those <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-values. Furthermore, no larger or smaller <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> can be achieved.  As a result, the range of the function is the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,4]\text{.}\)</span></p>
