<p>Once you have purchased the mold, but before you have created the first toy, you have manufactured <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> items, but you have already spent <span class="process-math">\(C(0)=100\)</span> dollars.  In other words, the cumulative cost of 0 items is 100$</p>
<p>After you have manufactured <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> item, you have spent <span class="process-math">\(C(1) = 100 + 5 = 101 \)</span> $.</p>
<p>After you have manufactured <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span> items, you have spent <span class="process-math">\(C(2) = 100 + 5 + 5 =  100 + 5\cdot 2 =  110 \)</span> $.</p>
<p>After you have manufactured <span class="process-math">\(x=30\)</span> items, you have spent <span class="process-math">\(C(30) = 100 + 5\cdot 30 = 250 \)</span> $.</p>
<p>Looking at the pattern in these equations, you can "see" the equation for the total cost  function.  For any number of items <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> the total cost will be</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
C(x) = 100 + 5\cdot x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p><em class="alert">Note:</em> There are several different ways to find a cost function. In this example, we followed an intuitive approach. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-totalcost2.html" title="Exploration 2.11">Exploration 2.11</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-totalcost3.html" title="Exploration 2.12">Exploration 2.12</a> (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-totalcost2.html" title="Exploration 2.11">Exploration 2.11–2.12</a>), we will use the point slope form of the line.</p>
