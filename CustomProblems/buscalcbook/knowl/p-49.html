<p>On the other hand, the value $1000 will definitely be in the range because you start on the first day of the first year with <span class="process-math">\(1000=f(0)\)</span> dollars in your account. And  $4,650 will be in the range because you end the 10th year with <span class="process-math">\(4650=f(10)=1000+365\cdot 10\)</span> in your account. Finally, every value between 1000 and 4650 will also be in the range, because you are continuously adding money to the account. But does that mean only the values for whole number years?  What about fractional years?   To answer that question, it helps to look at the graph of the savings function.</p>
