<p>Because our savings are spread out <em class="emphasis">evenly over the year</em>, we can find the value of our savings after “four and a half years”, as well as finding the value after three years exactly. In other words, the domain of our savings function contains decimals like <span class="process-math">\(4.5\)</span> years, as well as whole numbers like <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> years. This even will us to find the amount in the safe after <span class="process-math">\(40\)</span> <em class="alert">days</em>.  Assuming that there are 365 days in a year, day <span class="process-math">\(40\)</span> happens at <em class="alert">year</em> <span class="process-math">\(x=\frac{40}{365}=0.1096\text{.}\)</span></p>
