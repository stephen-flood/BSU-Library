<p>From a different perspective, it is clear that new cars have many features that older cars do not.  To oversimplify things, suppose  that a new car always has 10% more features than an older car.  If you are going to buy a car that is one year older, you will want the price to decrease enough to make up for that loss in additional features.</p>
<p>Said another way, many investments will lose a fixed percent of their value every year.  This is called <dfn class="terminology">declining balance</dfn> depreciation.</p>
<p>Suppose that the value of a different car decreases by 25% each year.  After one year, 75% of the value is retained.  After 2 years, 75% of the original 75% is retained, resulting in <span class="process-math">\(0.75\cdot 0.75= 0.5625\text{,}\)</span> or 56.25% of the value remains.  After 3 years, the value that remains is  <span class="process-math">\(0.75\cdot 0.75\cdot 0.75= 0.421875\text{,}\)</span> or 42.19% of the original value.</p>
<p>More generally, the value after <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> years is defined by the exponential equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\text{(value in year t)} = \text{(starting value)}\cdot \text{(percent of value retained after a year)}^t
