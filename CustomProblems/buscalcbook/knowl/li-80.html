<p>If you are measuring value as "percent of lifetime miles remaining", there would be <span class="process-math">\(160,000\)</span> of the total <span class="process-math">\(200,000\)</span> miles remaining, so the value of the car would be <span class="process-math">\(\frac{160,000}{200,000} = 0.8\text{,}\)</span> or 80%, of its original value.</p>
<p>After four years, the value of the car would be  <span class="process-math">\(\frac{140,000}{200,000} = 0.7\text{,}\)</span> or 70%, of its original value. And after five years, the value of the car would be  <span class="process-math">\(\frac{120,000}{200,000} = 0.6\text{,}\)</span> or 60%, of its original value.</p>
<p>In this case, the value is decreasing at a constant amount per year.  This is often called <dfn class="terminology">straight line depreciation</dfn>, since connecting the dots yields a linear equation</p>
