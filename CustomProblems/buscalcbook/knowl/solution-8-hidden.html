<p>The question of the range in that example is more complex. In words, a number will be in the range of our savings function if there is that amount in the safe at some year <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> between 0 and 10.</p>
<p>If you think about it, you'll never have a value of $900 in your account since it starts at $1000 and increases. You'll also never have  $1,000,000 in your account, since you are only adding about a dollar a day for 10 years. In other words, the numbers 900 and $1,000,000 are not in the range of our savings function.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the value $1000 will definitely be in the range because you start on the first day of the first year with <span class="process-math">\(1000=f(0)\)</span> dollars in your account. And  $4,650 will be in the range because you end the 10th year with <span class="process-math">\(4650=f(10)=1000+365\cdot 10\)</span> in your account. Finally, every value between 1000 and 4650 will also be in the range, because you are continuously adding money to the account. But does that mean only the values for whole number years?  What about fractional years?   To answer that question, it helps to look at the graph of the savings function.</p>

<p>In the graph of our function, we see that the value is added continuously (uniformly), so all <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> values between 1000 and 4650 can be achieved. Thus, the domain is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
1000 \leq y \leq 4650
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">In interval notation, this is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
[1000,4650]
\end{equation*}
</div>
