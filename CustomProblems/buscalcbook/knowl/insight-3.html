<p>Supply price and demand price capture the two sides of the market, the seller (supply) side and the buyer (demand) side.</p>
<p>Because supply price is an increasing function, and demand price is a decreasing function, there will often be a single point where the two curves intersect.</p>
<p>If the curves do not intersect, then the demand price is always lower than the supply price. In other words, there is no quanitity at which the market  willing to pay the item price required by  the seller.  In other words, no items are sold in this case.</p>
<p>The price where this happens is called the <dfn class="terminology">equilibrium point</dfn>, because at this quaintity, the supply price and demand price are equal (in equilibrium).</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch-algebra_linearfunctions.html#insight-3" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
