<p>Inflation refers to the process of prices increasing over time. Often, we talk about prices increasing at the same rate per year, over a period of several years.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that prices are increasing at <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span>% per year, which corresponds to a decimal rate <span class="process-math">\(r = \frac{5}{100}=0.05\text{.}\)</span> Suppose also that a certain product costs <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span>$ in the first year.</p>
<p>One year later, the cost is the original amount <span class="process-math">\(P=100\)</span> plus a change of <span class="process-math">\(rP = 0.05\cdot 100 = 5\)</span> dollars.  In other words, the value one year later is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V(1) = 100 + 0.05\cdot 100 = 105.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">In our notation for percent change, we can also write this as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V(1) = 100 \cdot (1+0.05) = 105.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>How much will the value be after two years? In the second year, the value of <span class="process-math">\(105\)</span> increases a second time, also by 5%, or a rate of <span class="process-math">\(r=0.05\text{.}\)</span>  That means</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V(2) = 105 + 105\cdot 0.05 = 110.25
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">In our notation for percent change, we can write this as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V(2) = 105\cdot (1+0.05) = 105\cdot (1.05)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">But the leading coefficent of <span class="process-math">\(105\)</span> can also be rewritten, since <span class="process-math">\(105 = 100\cdot (1.05)\text{.}\)</span>  In other words,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V(2) = 100 \cdot (1.05) \cdot (1.05) = 100\cdot (1.05)^2
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We can find the value after three years in the same way. We will take the value from the second year, and increase it by a rate of <span class="process-math">\(r=0.05\text{.}\)</span> Furthermore, that increase is equivalent to multiplying the value from the second year by another coefficient of <span class="process-math">\(1+0.05=1.05\text{.}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V(3) = 100 \cdot (1.05)\cdot (1.05)\cdot (1.05) = 100\cdot (1.05)^3
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This line of reasoning works for any positive period of time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> giving us a formula for the value of an object with original value <span class="process-math">\(100\text{,}\)</span> where the price has been increased 5% for <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> years.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V(t) = 100 \cdot (1.05)^t = 100\cdot (1 + 0.05)^t
\end{equation*}
