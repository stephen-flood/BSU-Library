<p>You may have noticed a little bit of a change in how we are thinking about price and revenue versus how we thought about gas prices earlier in the semester. The gas prices <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is a function of time, so the change in gas price <span class="process-math">\(\Delta G\)</span> simply measures how much the price has changed between two days. But for price and revenue, the different values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> correspond to different and <em class="emphasis">incompatible</em> scenarios where you imagine selling a different number of units.</p>
<p>To see how these fit together, imagine you are running a sequence of experiments where on day 1, you set the price so you sell 1 unit. Then, on day 2, you set the price so you sell 2 units, and so on. In this experiment <span class="process-math">\(\Delta R\)</span> measures the change in revenue as you move between different days, which each correspond to a different scenario (possible universe).</p>
<p>Just remember - with revenue your goal isn't the experiment itself. You want to <em class="emphasis">use</em> this thought experiment to find the single scenerio <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> where you have the best revenue.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch_polynomials_and_rationals.html#graphsintimevsitems" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
