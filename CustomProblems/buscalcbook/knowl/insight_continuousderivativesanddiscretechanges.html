<p>Previously, we have used histograms to understand the connection between graphs of total functions <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> change functions <span class="process-math">\(\Delta C\text{,}\)</span> and average rates of change <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x}\)</span></p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>In <a href="ch-algebra_linearfunctions.html#sec-algeba-linear-cost" class="internal" title="Section 2.3: Item Cost, Total Cost, and Linear Functions">Section 2.3</a>, we carefully studied economic functions such as the total (cumulative) cost function  <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>In <a href="ch-functions.html#sec_graphsoftotalsandchanges" class="internal" title="Section 1.4: Graphs of Totals and Changes">Section 1.4</a>, we studied the relationship between the graph of a total <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and the change graph <span class="process-math">\(\Delta C\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>And in <a href="ch_totalschanges.html#sec_graphsofrateschangesandtotals" class="internal" title="Section 7.2: Graphs of Rates, Changes, and Totals">Section 7.2</a> we seen that the average change graph <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{\Delta C}{\Delta x}\)</span> is just  a scaled version of the graph of the change <span class="process-math">\(\Delta C\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, we will see that these  concrete applications are very closely related to the continuous total function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and  derivatives (slope) functions <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> that we have studied in this section.</p>
<p>To make this concrete, we will look at a specific total (cumulative) cost function.  Let</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
C(x) = -0.05 x^2 + 0.8 x - 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">As in previous sections, we can create the graphs of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\Delta C\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x}\text{.}\)</span> <div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/image_totalchange_continuousanddiscrete_1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> How do the functions <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C'(x)\)</span> fit into this picture? The graph of the total is a discrete version of <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>To find an equation for the derivaitve (slope) function, you can use the techniques from this section to find that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
C'(x) = -0.1 x + 0.8
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Now that we have formulas for <span class="process-math">\(y=C(x)\)</span> and its derivative <span class="process-math">\(C'(x)\text{,}\)</span> let's see how the derivative relates to the graphs of <span class="process-math">\(\Delta y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\text{.}\)</span> The total <span class="process-math">\(C = -0.05 x^2 + 0.8 x - 1\)</span> is graphed on the left, and the derivative <span class="process-math">\(C' = -0.1 x + 0.8\)</span> is graphed on the same axes as <span class="process-math">\(\Delta C\)</span> in the middle, and as <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x}\)</span> on the right. What is the relationship between the derivative <span class="process-math">\(C'\text{,}\)</span> the change <span class="process-math">\(\Delta C\text{,}\)</span> and the AROC <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x}\text{?}\)</span></p>

<p>From the graphs above, it looks like the derivative <span class="process-math">\(C'\)</span> is very close to the average rate of change <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{\Delta C}{\Delta x}\text{,}\)</span> and is a scaled version of the graph of the change <span class="process-math">\(\Delta C\text{.}\)</span> For that reason, the derivative <span class="process-math">\(C'\)</span> is often abbreviated <span class="process-math">\(C' = \dfrac{dC}{dx}\text{.}\)</span> To see why, note that <span class="process-math">\(\Delta\)</span> is Greek for letter “D,” so the notation <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dC}{dx}\)</span> is intended to help you remember that it's very closely related to <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x}\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch_tangentsecant.html#insight_continuousderivativesanddiscretechanges" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
