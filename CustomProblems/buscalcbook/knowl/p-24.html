<p>To allow the amount of time to vary, we introduce an independent variable. Often, we use <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for the independent variable, which in this case is time. We also often use <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> for the dependent variable, which in this case is the amount saved. Although <span class="process-math">\(x,y\)</span> are common variables, we could also have chosen other letters, such as <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> for value and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> for time.</p>
