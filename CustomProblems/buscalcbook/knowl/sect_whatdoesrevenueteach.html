</h4>
<p>As soon as you decide on how much you want to sell each item for, and print the price tag, you are locked into that price until you decide to print a new price tag. Because the quantity you sell will change depending on the price you choose, it is important to think through the implications of your choice <dfn class="terminology">before</dfn> you make that decision. In practice, this usually means a multi-step process:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Do market research to decide how many units you are likely to sell at different item prices.</p></li>
<li><p>Use this information to get a function for price as a function of the scenario <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> This gives a model of how the price changes depending on which possible scenario you are in.</p></li>
<li><p>The revenue for each scenario <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is the product of that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> by the scenario's item price.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You then compare the different values of Revenue <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> and select the scenario (possible universe) that works best for you. In this case, the meaning of the change in revenue <span class="process-math">\(\Delta R\)</span> between different values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a bit complex. Here, <span class="process-math">\(\Delta R\)</span> represents how much revenue would have changed if you had chosen a different possible universe <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> by deciding to sell additional units by lowering the fixed unit cost that everyone pays.</p>
<p>In other words, the maximum revenue occurs when increasing the quantity <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> stops increasing the total revenue and starts decreasing the total revenue, because <span class="process-math">\(\Delta R\)</span> stops being positive and starts being negative. This is an important feature, and we'll come back to this later in the semester.</p>
