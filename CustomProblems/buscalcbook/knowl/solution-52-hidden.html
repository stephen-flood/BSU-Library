<p>We must solve the equation <span class="process-math">\(-x^2 + 3x -2 = 0\text{.}\)</span> We can do this by factoring, or by using the quadratic equation.</p>
<p>Using the quadratic equation <span class="process-math">\(x = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4\cdot (-1) \cdot (-2)}}{2\cdot(-1)}\text{,}\)</span> we get that <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We will evenutally need to solve equations by factoring, so this is a good time to start practicing.  We will rewrite the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
-x^2 + 3x -2 = 0 \text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">It is easiest to factor when the leading term is just  <span class="process-math">\(x^2\text{.}\)</span>  Here, the leading coefficient is <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{,}\)</span> so we should divide each term on the left by <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{.}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
(-1)\cdot \Big(\frac{-1}{-1}x^2 + \frac{3}{-1}x -\frac{2}{-1}\Big) = 0 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Essentially, we are "un-distributing" the leading term of <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{.}\)</span>  Simplifying the equation down, we now get</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
(-1)\cdot \Big(x^2 -3 x +2 \Big) = 0 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Now we can factor the quadratic inside.  We want to find some numbers <span class="process-math">\(d_1,d_2\)</span> such that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x^2 - 3x + 2 = (x+d_1)(x+d_2) = x^2 + (d_1+d_2)x + d_1\cdot d_2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">In other words, we want numbers that add to <span class="process-math">\(-3\)</span> and multiply to positive <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span>  Trying <span class="process-math">\(d_1=-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d_2=-2\text{,}\)</span> we get <span class="process-math">\(-1+-2=-3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((-1)(-2)=2\)</span> as desired.  That means we can rewrite our original equation as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
(-1)\cdot \Big(x-1\Big)\Big(x-2\Big) = 0 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">But the product of two numbers can only equal zero if the individual numbers are zero.  That means that the equation is equivalent to <em class="emphasis">either</em> having <span class="process-math">\(x-1=0\)</span> <em class="emphasis">or</em> having <span class="process-math">\(x-2=0\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>In other words, this is equivalent to having <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{,}\)</span> which are the two <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-intercepts of our quadratic.</p>
