<p>You begin with $1000 in a safe, and add $365 each year, spread out evenly over the year. Furthermore, you commit to keeping this up for ten years. You want to study the value in the safe as a function of time.</p>
<p>To allow the amount of time to vary, we introduce an independent variable. Often, we use <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for the independent variable, which in this case is time. We also often use <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> for the dependent variable, which in this case is the amount saved. Although <span class="process-math">\(x,y\)</span> are common variables, we could also have chosen other letters, such as <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> for value and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> for time.</p>
<p>Putting this together, we get</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
y = f(x) = 1000 + 365 x \text{ for }x\text{ in } [0,10]
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Reading from left to right, this says that the output balance <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in $ is equal to a function of the input time <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and that we will use the letter <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to refer this function.</p>
<p>It also says that this function is defined by a <em class="emphasis">rule</em>, which says to take the number of years <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> to multiply that by 365, and then to add $1000.</p>
<p>Finally, that sentence says that this rule applies only when the input <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is in the closed interval <span class="process-math">\([0,10]\text{,}\)</span> which means that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> can be any number in the interval <span class="process-math">\(0\leq x\leq 10\text{.}\)</span> In other words, this rule specifies its <em class="alert">domain</em>.</p>
<p>Because our savings are spread out <em class="emphasis">evenly over the year</em>, we can find the value of our savings after “four and a half years”, as well as finding the value after three years exactly. In other words, the domain of our savings function contains decimals like <span class="process-math">\(4.5\)</span> years, as well as whole numbers like <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> years. This even will us to find the amount in the safe after <span class="process-math">\(40\)</span> <em class="alert">days</em>.  Assuming that there are 365 days in a year, day <span class="process-math">\(40\)</span> happens at <em class="alert">year</em> <span class="process-math">\(x=\frac{40}{365}=0.1096\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch-functions.html#example_function_notation_and_investment" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
