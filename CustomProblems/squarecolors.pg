BEGIN_TEXT
In how many ways can we color the sides of a square with the colors red, 
blue, yellow, green so that each side has a different color? 
We treat colorings that can be rotated into each other as equivalent.
$BR
Your answer is : \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
END_TEXT

$ans = 6;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));

There are 3! such colorings because we can adopt the convention that red is 
always on top (to account for the rotation constraint), and there are 3!  ways to assign all remaining colors to the the right, left, and 
bottom sides.
